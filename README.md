TECHNICAL TASK: Develop a console application using the "Observer" pattern that converts decimal numbers provided by the subject into different calculation systems through the use of observers. The program should consider the sign and value of the transferred number, and allow for the following options:

• Notify the user if the number is too large or negative.

• Output the number in its own calculation system.
