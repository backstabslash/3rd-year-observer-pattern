TECHNICAL TASK:
Using the "Observer" pattern, develop a program in which the decimal numbers given by the subject are converted into various other systems of calculation by observers. Depending on the sign of the transferred number and its value, the following options are possible:

• Report that the number is too large / negative;

• Output the number passed by the subject in its own system of calculation.
